# Discord-Webhook-Spammer (DWS)
This is a lil project that i made. It's a pretty Advanced WebHook Spammer, that's why it isn't just a simple .py that u can run in your browser.
I will also Update it often with more and more features!



# Tutorial on the Download
1. Download file.
2. Open it.
3. Windows Defender might says "Windows Protected your PC", but just ignore it and click on "more info" and then "Run Anyway".
4. That's it, now just fill out the text fields and spam the webhook lol.



# Trouble Shooting
If u get a pop-up error message saying something about a limit, it is most likely because u didn't entered a webhook and or it could be because of discord's strict api requests for webhooks. Just ignore the message box.
